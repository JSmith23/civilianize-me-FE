The front end repository for the CivilianizeMe App.


## Design

The UX was designed specifically for military veterans. Visibility was tested in different screen exposures to sunlight to determine the optimal color pallate. The white text on the graphite buttons allows users to see the crisis button and all of their resources even when a screen is facing directly at the sun (though we would not recommend using the site this way). We believe this will be helpful in situations where users have vision impairment or are using the app outside. Though this feature might seem insignificant, there are many homeless veterans, so we feel that testing for outdoor use was a necessary design integration to this project.

Other UX implementations:
-After surveying some veteran friends of ours, we got some good ideas about what to avoid and what to pursue with the design. We gathered that the general consensus was that the majority of government websites vets use have almost no front end design other than basic formatting and huge blocks of text. Veterans come out of the military and are expected to read hundreds of pages of online articles about how to apply, submit, and get access to various resources. We wanted to counter this by having a very simplified view that makes the resource finding process as short as humanly possible. We also gathered that there was a general overexposure to military images, such as the red/white/blue theme, unforms, vehicles, weapons, and more. Our design avoids this entirely to give the veteran mind a soothing break.
